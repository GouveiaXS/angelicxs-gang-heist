# gang-heist

Hi all,

Another ESX and QBcore compatible script.

In the attempt to make Gangs in RP have more incentive to interact I have created a ‘Gang Heist’ script, so that rival gangs can ‘steal’ from each other.

Easily customizable so you can decide who, what and where the actual event takes place and there’s even an opportunity to set a custom minigame if you want. Examples, as always, have been provided.

There is the option to have the stolen money come straight from the society accounts as well (by default supports the regular qb-mangement / esx accountmanagement). If you use other banking/society systems you may need to change that manually.

Check out other free scripts by me on CFX FiveM or my Tebex: https://angelicxs.tebex.io/
